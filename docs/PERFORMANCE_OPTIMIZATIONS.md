# Performance Optimizations for HyperLiquid Risk Dashboard

This document outlines performance optimizations implemented to improve the responsiveness and reliability of the HyperLiquid Risk Dashboard, particularly when deployed on Render.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Non-Blocking Operations

The application has been modified to run CPU-intensive operations in a separate thread pool, preventing them from blocking the main event loop:

- Added a semaphore to limit concurrent intensive operations
- Created a helper function `run_intensive_task` to execute operations in a blocking thread
- Applied timeouts to prevent operations from running indefinitely

### 2. HTTP Server Optimizations

The HTTP server configuration has been optimized:

- Increased the number of worker threads to 4
- Set keep-alive timeout to 75 seconds
- Set client request timeout to 60 seconds

### 3. Health Check Endpoint

The health check endpoint has been kept simple and fast, ensuring it responds quickly even when the system is under load.

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables for Render

Add these environment variables to your Render dashboard to optimize performance:

```
MAX_THREADS=4
RUST_MIN_STACK=8388608
```

### 2. Memory Optimization

If you're experiencing memory issues, consider:

- Setting explicit memory limits in your Render configuration
- Adding a memory limit to your application:

```rust
// In main function
let mem_limit = env::var("MEMORY_LIMIT_MB")
    .ok()
    .and_then(|v| v.parse::<usize>().ok())
    .unwrap_or(512) * 1024 * 1024; // Default to 512MB

// Set memory limit
jemalloc_ctl::set_limit(mem_limit);
```

### 3. Database Connection Pooling

If you're using a database, ensure you're using connection pooling with appropriate limits:

```rust
// Create a connection pool with appropriate limits
let pool = r2d2::Pool::builder()
    .max_size(5) // Limit max connections
    .min_idle(Some(1)) // Keep at least one connection ready
    .idle_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(300))) // Close idle connections after 5 minutes
    .build(manager)
    .expect("Failed to create pool");
```

### 4. Caching

Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data:

```rust
// Add a cache to the AppState
struct AppState {
    risk_system: Mutex<RiskManagementSystem>,
    data_logger: DataLogger,
    intensive_ops_semaphore: Semaphore,
    cache: Mutex<HashMap<String, (SystemTime, Value)>>,
}

// Use the cache in endpoints
async fn get_cached_data(cache_key: &str, cache: &Mutex<HashMap<String, (SystemTime, Value)>>, ttl: Duration) -> Option<Value> {
    let cache_guard = cache.lock().unwrap();
    if let Some((timestamp, data)) = cache_guard.get(cache_key) {
        if timestamp.elapsed().unwrap() < ttl {
            return Some(data.clone());
        }
    }
    None
}
```

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

Implement more detailed monitoring to identify performance bottlenecks:

```rust
// Add timing information to logs
let start = std::time::Instant::now();
// Perform operation
let duration = start.elapsed();
info!("Operation completed in {:?}", duration);
```

### 6. Rate Limiting

Consider more aggressive rate limiting for expensive endpoints:

```rust
// Configure stricter rate limits for expensive endpoints
let expensive_ops_config = GovernorConfigBuilder::default()
    .per_second(2) // Only 2 requests per second
    .burst_size(3) // Allow burst of 3 requests
    .finish()
    .unwrap();

// Apply to specific routes
web::scope("/api/expensive")
    .wrap(Governor::new(&expensive_ops_config))
    .route("/analysis", web::get().to(get_expensive_analysis))
```

## Monitoring Performance

After implementing these optimizations, monitor your application's performance:

1. Check Render logs for any timeout or error messages
2. Monitor CPU and memory usage in the Render dashboard
3. Track response times for different endpoints
4. Watch for health check failures

If you continue to experience issues, consider upgrading your Render plan to get more resources or further optimizing your application's performance.
