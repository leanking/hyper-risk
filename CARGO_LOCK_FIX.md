# Cargo.lock Version Fix

## The Issue

When deploying the HyperLiquid Risk Dashboard to Render using Docker, you might encounter the following error:

```
error: failed to parse lock file at: /app/Cargo.lock

Caused by:
  lock file version `4` was found, but this version of Cargo does not understand this lock file, perhaps Cargo needs to be updated?
```

Additionally, some dependencies require newer versions of Rust:

```
error: package `parity-scale-codec v3.7.4` cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.79.0 or newer, while the currently active rustc version is 1.77.2
```

And other dependencies require even newer versions:

```
error: rustc 1.79.0 is not supported by the following packages:
  litemap@0.7.5 requires rustc 1.81
  native-tls@0.2.14 requires rustc 1.80.0
  zerofrom@0.1.6 requires rustc 1.81
```

These errors occur because:
1. The Cargo.lock file in your project was created with a newer version of Rust than what was being used in the Docker image
2. Various dependencies require Rust 1.81 or newer

## The Solution

The solution is to update the Dockerfile.render to:

1. Use a newer version of Rust (1.81)
2. Remove the existing Cargo.lock file
3. Regenerate the Cargo.lock file during the build process

Here's how the fix works:

1. We updated the base image to `rust:1.81-slim`
2. We changed the build process to:
   - Copy all project files
   - Remove the existing Cargo.lock file
   - Generate a fresh Cargo.lock file with the current Rust version
   - Build the application

This ensures that:
- The Cargo.lock file is compatible with the version of Rust used in the Docker image
- All dependencies can be built with the available Rust version

## Testing the Fix

You can test the fix locally by running:

```bash
./test_docker_fix.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build the Docker image with the fixed Dockerfile
2. Check if the build was successful
3. Optionally run the container to test it

## If You Still Encounter Issues

If you still encounter issues with the Cargo.lock file or dependency versions, you can try:

1. Manually deleting the Cargo.lock file from your project before building:
   ```bash
   rm Cargo.lock
   ```

2. Checking if your project has any dependencies that require a specific version of Rust and updating the Dockerfile accordingly

3. Pinning specific dependency versions in your Cargo.toml file to avoid requiring the latest Rust version
